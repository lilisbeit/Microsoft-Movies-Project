## Overview

Microsoft wants to enter the movie business as a creator of original content.  My task is to advise them on how to make popular movies that will draw subscribers to its new streaming video service.  I used data from IMDb, the Internet Movie Database, to investigate three questions:

1. Which movie genres are the most popular?
2. Does the length of a movie affect its ratings and popularity?
3. Who are the top actors and directors in the popular genres?

To measure a film's popularity, I used the product of its average rating and the number of people who rated it.  To find the most popular genres, I calculated the median popularity value for each genre.  I discovered that the most popular movie genres among IMDb users are Action, Crime, and Adventure.  I also analyzed the length of movies in these genres, and found that a longer runtime is correlated with increased popularity.  I then found the 30 actors and directors who have made the most popular movies in these genres.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees big tech companies such as Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu successfully drawing customers with streaming video services featuring original content, and so has decided to enter the streaming space.  Microsoft hopes to lure subscribers with original movies, but doesn't know anything about how to make movies that are highly rated and appeal to a wide audience.  They need to generate a few "big win" movies to kickstart their entry into the streaming arena.

## Data

To analyze this problem, I used data from IMDb, the Internet Movie Database.  IMDb contains information on over 140,000 movies, including actors, genres, runtimes, and ratings.  While IMDb does collect information from filmakers, the bulk of its data are submitted by  individuals in the movie industry and visitors to the IMDb website.

## Results

### Action, Crime, and Adventure win!

Action, Crime, and Adventure emerge as the three most popular genres.

### Longer movies win!

In all three of the most popular genres, the median length of the top 25% of movies by popularity was significantly (11-15 minutes) longer than the median length of the bottom 75%.  Microsoft should aim for their movies to be between 105 and 110 minutes long.



### Let's get recruiting!

This analysis provides Microsoft with lists of actors and directors who draw large audiences and make highly rated films.  To create a few "big win" movies to build its brand, Microsoft should consider recruiting these individuals.



## Conclusions

### Recommendations:

- To successfully break into the streaming movie business, Microsoft should focus on Action, Crime, and Adventure movies.  These genres have the highest median popularity, defined as a movie's average rating times the number of people who rated it.

- Microsoft should make movies that are around 105-110 minutes long.  In all three of the top genres, the median length of the top 25% of movies have runtimes in this range.  The bottom 75% of movies have median runtimes around 90-97 minutes.

- I provided lists of the actors and directors who have made the most popular movies in each of the top three genres.  For this part of the analysis, "popular movies" is defined as movies in the top 5% of popularity among all movies.  I then found which actors and directors were associated with movies in the top 3 genres within this top 5%.  These lists can serve as a starting point for recruiting actors and directors who are highly rated and draw a large audience.

### Further investigation:

While this analysis provides some direction for Microsoft, other questions should be answered to fully solve this business problem.

For example, although runtime is correlated with ratings and popularity, it's not clear that increased runtime is the cause of increased popularity.  Both factors might share a common cause, such as a large production budget.

In general, a budget analysis by genre would be helpful so Microsoft can predict the return on investment of its movies.  While they need a few hit movies to lure new customers, eventually they will need to make the subscription service profitable.  It is possible that the most popular genres are also the most expensive, and that by going down a few notches to Romance or Mystery, they could achieve greater profitability.
